/* Solarized Dark theme for Eric6
 * Taken from https://gist.github.com/Zren/e91ad5197f9d6b6d410f
 * Author: Chris Holland
 *
 * Theme Notes:
 *  - This theme is designed to work on top of the Fusion or the Plastique client style.
 *    It will look weird on almost all the others (including the system default).
